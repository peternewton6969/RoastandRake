// Character Summary — calls the Claude API to turn a player's character notes into
// a short, sarcastic-but-affectionate locker-room blurb ("according to the Captain").
//
// This app has no backend, so the request goes straight from the browser. The
// Anthropic API key is NOT baked into the build (that would leak it on the public
// GitHub Pages deploy) — instead it's entered once by the user and kept in this
// device's localStorage. `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` acknowledges the direct-call model.

// The key is collected with an in-app input (see PlayerForm) and kept here — NOT a

// flow because on iOS Safari they can leave the page's text inputs unresponsive after
// dismissal, which previously broke "add another note" after generating a summary.
